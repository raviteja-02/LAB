    "  <li>The individuals that are more successful (fittest) are chosen to mate and produce more offspring compared to others.</li>\n",
    "  <li>The genes from the \"fittest\" parent are propagated throughout the generation. Sometimes, parents create offspring that are better than either parent.</li>\n",

    "Once the initial generation is created, the algorithm evolves the generation using the following operators:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "  <li>Selection Operator: This operator gives preference to individuals with good fitness scores, allowing them to pass on their genes to the successive generations.</li>\n",
    "  <li>Crossover Operator: This represents the mating between individuals. Two individuals are selected using the selection operator, and random crossover sites are chosen. The genes at these crossover sites are exchanged, creating completely new offspring.</li>\n",
    "  <li>Mutation Operator: This operator introduces random changes (mutations) in the offspring to maintain diversity in the population and avoid premature convergence.</li>\n",

    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li>Characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and other special symbols are considered as genes.</li>\n",
    "  <li>A string generated by these characters is considered as a chromosome, solution, or individual.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",

    "<br>The fitness score is calculated as the number of characters that differ from the characters in the target string at a particular index. Individuals with lower fitness values are given more preference."
