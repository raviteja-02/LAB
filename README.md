# Experiments
This is a collection of experiments that can be performed in various fields using Python. Each experiment has its own specific requirements and implementation details.

## Experiment 1: Probability Calculation
Calculate the probability that a student is absent given that today is Friday, using Bayes' rule. The following information is given:
The probability that it is Friday is 20%.
The probability that it is Friday and that a student is absent is 3%.

## Experiment 2: Database Data Extraction
Extract data from a database using Python. The specific libraries and implementation details will depend on the type of database being used.

## Experiment 3: K-Nearest Neighbors Classification
Implement k-nearest neighbors classification using Python. This algorithm is used to classify new data points based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors in the training data.

## Experiment 4: K-Means Clustering
Given the following data, which specify classifications for nine combinations of VAR1 and VAR2 predict a classification for a case where VAR1=0.906 and VAR2=0.606, using the result of k-means clustering with 3 means (i.e., 3 centroids)

VAR1	VAR2	CLASS
1.713	1.586	0
0.180	1.786	1
0.353	1.240	1
0.940	1.566	0
1.486	0.759	1
1.266	1.106	0
1.540	0.419	1
0.459	1.799	1
0.773	0.186	1

## Experiment 5: Conditional Probability Calculation
Calculate the unconditional probability of golf and the conditional probability of single given medRisk in a dataset. The input attributes are income, recreation, job, status, age-group, and home-owner.

## Experiment 6: Linear Regression
Implement linear regression using Python. Linear regression is a method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

## Experiment 7: Naïve Bayes Classification
Implement Naïve Bayes theorem to classify English text. Naïve Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm that uses Bayes theorem to calculate the probability of a data point belonging to a certain class.

## Experiment 8: Genetic Algorithm Optimization
Implement an algorithm to demonstrate the significance of genetic algorithm. Genetic algorithms are a type of optimization algorithm that mimics the process of natural selection to find the optimal solution to a problem.

## Experiment 9: Back-Propagation Algorithm
Implement the finite words classification system using the back-propagation algorithm. Back-propagation is a popular algorithm for training artificial neural networks, including finite word classification systems.
